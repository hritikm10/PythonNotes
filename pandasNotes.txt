#What is Pandas?
------------------------------------
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
Relevant data is very important in data science.

What Can Pandas Do?
------------------------------------
Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:
1.Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
2.What is average value?
3.Max value?
4.Min value?
5.Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.


import pandas as pd
mydataset = {
  'cars': ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
  'passings': [3, 7, 2]
}
myvar = pd.DataFrame(mydataset)
print(myvar)

OUTPUT :
    cars  passings
0    BMW         3
1  Volvo         7
2   Ford         2

NOTE: Pandas DataFrame is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns. Pandas DataFrame consists of three principal components, the data, rows, and columns.





#What is a Series?
------------------------------------
A Pandas Series is like a column in a table.
It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.

#Create a simple Pandas Series from a list:
import pandas as pd
a = [1, 7, 2]
myvar = pd.Series(a)
print(myvar)

OUTPUT -
0    1
1    7
2    2


#With the index argument, you can name your own labels.
import pandas as pd
a = [1, 7, 2]
myvar = pd.Series(a, index = ["x", "y", "z"])
print(myvar)

OUTPUT -
x    1
y    7
z    2


#Key/Value Objects as Series
------------------------------------
You can also use a key/value object, like a dictionary, when creating a Series.
import pandas as pd
calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}
myvar = pd.Series(calories)
print(myvar)

OUTPUT -
day1    420
day2    380
day3    390

Note: The keys of the dictionary become the labels.




#To select only some of the items in the dictionary, use the index argument and specify only the items you want to include in the Series.
import pandas as pd
calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}
myvar = pd.Series(calories, index = ["day1", "day2"])
print(myvar)
OUTPUT -
day1    420
day2    380



#DataFrames
------------------------------------
Data sets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames.
Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.

import pandas as pd
data = {
  "calories": [420, 380, 390],
  "duration": [50, 40, 45]
}
myvar = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(myvar)

OUTPUT -
   calories  duration
0       420        50
1       380        40
2       390        45



#Locate Row
Pandas use the loc attribute to return one or more specified row(s)

1.print(df.loc[0])
calories    420
duration     50

2.print(df.loc[[0, 1]])
calories  duration
0       420        50
1       380        40


Note: When using [], the result is a Pandas DataFrame.




#Load Files Into a DataFrame
------------------------------------
If your data sets are stored in a file, Pandas can load them into a DataFrame.

Load a comma separated file (CSV file) into a DataFrame:
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df)
